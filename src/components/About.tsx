					<p>
						Originally from Kazakhstan, I moved to Canada in the winter of 2021
						to pursue higher education at Mount Allison University. I graduated
						in May 2025 with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and
						Mathematics. Throughout my time at Mount Allison, I actively engaged
						in campus life through a variety of leadership roles, including
						serving as International Orientation Chair, Head Mentor, and
						International Projects Intern. Academically, I worked as a Teaching
						Assistant for the Data Structures and Algorithms course and as a
						Research Assistant in the Psychology Department, where I developed
						software to support data collection for ongoing research.
					</p>
					<p>
						Iâ€™m currently seeking a full-time opportunity in software
						development where I can apply my technical skills, leadership
						experience, and passion for problem-solving.
