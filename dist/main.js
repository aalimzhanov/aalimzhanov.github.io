I was born in Kazakhstan and lived there until the age of 18. On January 15th, 2021, I packed my suitcase, said goodbye to my family and friends, and moved to Canada. Three years later, I am studying at one of the top undergraduate universities in Canada, majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Maths. Was I expecting all of this when I boarded that plane? Probably not... Am I happy with where I am in life right now?
