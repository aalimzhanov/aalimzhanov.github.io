							Computer Science & Mathematics Graduate from Mount Allison
							University
						</h2>
						<p>
							Originally from Kazakhstan, I moved to Canada in the winter of
							2021 to pursue higher education at Mount Allison University. I
							graduated in May 2025 with a Bachelor of Science in Computer
							Science and Mathematics. Throughout my time at Mount Allison, I
							actively engaged in campus life through a variety of leadership
							roles, including serving as International Orientation Chair, Head
							Mentor, and International Projects Intern. Academically, I worked
							as a Teaching Assistant for the Data Structures and Algorithms
							course and as a Research Assistant in the Psychology Department,
							where I developed software to support data collection for ongoing
							research. Iâ€™m currently seeking a full-time opportunity in
							software development where I can apply my technical skills,
							leadership experience, and passion for problem-solving.
